### ⚙️ Configuration Files

- `jest.config.js` - Jest configuration
- `jest.setup.js` - Client-side test setup
- `jest.setup.server.js` - Server-side test setup
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `lighthouserc.js` - Performance testing config
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - CI/CD pipeline

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm run test:all
```

### Run Individual Test Types

```bash
npm test                    # Unit/integration tests
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage      # Tests with coverage report
npm run test:e2e           # End-to-end tests
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development with test watching
npm run dev                 # Terminal 1: Start app
npm run test:watch         # Terminal 2: Watch tests
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The pipeline automatically runs on every `git push`:

1. **Code Quality** - ESLint and TypeScript checks
2. **Unit Tests** - Jest with MongoDB Memory Server
3. **Build Test** - Verify app builds successfully
4. **E2E Tests** - Playwright across multiple browsers
5. **Security Audit** - npm audit for vulnerabilities
6. **Performance Test** - Lighthouse CI (on PRs only)

### Triggers

- Push to `main`, `master`, or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to these branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

## 🎯 Test Coverage

### Current Test Coverage:

- **API Endpoints**: Tools, Website Check, Reviews
- **Components**: WebsiteCard, SearchInput
- **Utilities**: URL validation and normalization
- **E2E Flows**: Homepage, Authentication, Dashboard

### Coverage Goals:

- Unit Tests: 80%+ line coverage
- API Tests: 90%+ endpoint coverage
- E2E Tests: All critical user journeys

## 🛠️ Next Steps

### 1. Install Playwright Browsers (if running E2E tests)

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables (for full testing)

```bash
# Create .env.test.local
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/rateit-test
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-test-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Add More Tests

- Expand API test coverage
- Add more component tests
- Test additional user flows
- Add integration tests for complex features

### 4. Monitor and Maintain

- Review test reports regularly
- Update tests when adding features
- Monitor performance metrics
- Keep dependencies updated

## 📊 Testing Commands Reference

```bash
# Development
npm run test:watch              # Watch mode for TDD
npm run test:coverage          # Generate coverage report
npm test -- --no-coverage     # Run without coverage
npm test filename.test.ts      # Run specific test file

# Debugging
npm test -- --detectOpenHandles --forceExit  # Debug hanging tests
npx jest --clearCache          # Clear Jest cache
PWDEBUG=1 npm run test:e2e    # Debug Playwright tests

# E2E Testing
npm run test:e2e:ui           # Run E2E with UI
npx playwright test --debug   # Debug specific E2E test
npx playwright show-report    # View test report

# CI/CD
npm run test:all              # Run all tests (same as CI)
npm run lint                  # Code quality check
npm run build                 # Build verification
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Tests hanging**: Use `--detectOpenHandles --forceExit`
2. **MongoDB errors**: Ensure no port conflicts on 27017
3. **Playwright issues**: Run `npx playwright install`
4. **Module resolution**: Clear cache with `npx jest --clearCache`
